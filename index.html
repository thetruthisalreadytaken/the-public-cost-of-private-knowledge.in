      <p>For some time now ideas or 'intellectual property' have been seen as <strong>property</strong> or a <strong>private good</strong>:<p>

      <p>But this isn't <strong> reality</strong>.   Intellectual property is actually a <strong>public good</strong>:</p>

      <p>Using a public good doesn't make it any less available to another.  You can't (easily or without modification) exclude it's use from someone else. <p>
      <p>Some time ago we decided to convert IP into a private good by creating laws to make it a crime to share intellectual property without permission</p>

      <p>We did this in the hope that it would encourage more IP to be created.   However what is easily overlooked is in doing this we make a public good artificially scarce and ...</p>

    Businesses which compete to efficently and brutally advertise and sell what could otherwise be free.   Both in cost and in speech.  Usually wielding the same technologies which could be used to free it.

    <p> This isn't in support of one piece of legislation or another.  This isn't about SOPA or PIPA.   These are red herrings- offering an artificial answer to an artificial problem.   A detail to be contested so no one will think to challenge the premise.  We're at a turning point when it comes to how we will percieve, pursue, and pay for intellectual work as a society .   </p>

    <p>Either we will choose to continue to see IP as a loaf of bread - to be bought or sold - or we will see it as a light to be shared.   Current patent and copyright law, like any artificial creation, is imperfect.  
    The abstraction of 'intellectual property' is leaking- seen everyday as information technology makes IP shimmer from bread back to light and as we continually commit ourselves through tireless effort to see as it's artifical legal fiction. </p>

    <p>To vigilantly police ourselves and those we trade with to regard ideas as property and to see those who don't as criminals.  Because if we don't - if we allow the facade to fall away and allow everyone access to anything - much of what we consider valuable will be effortlessly created and consumed.  We will be able to splash in the sum of our human knowedge like a child on the shore and <b>we will changed</b>. </p>
